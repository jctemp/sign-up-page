# sign-up page

This [task](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form) requires one to create a sign-up page for a fictional brand.
The goal is to work with `HTML` and `CSS` to create a page.
Optionally, one can add further responsiveness and validation with JavaScript.

## lessons learned

Organising `CSS` files is difficult.
Especially with a growing project, more selects are performed to fine-tune the layout or general design.
Applying advanced selectors helps to reduce selections.
Combining JavaScript and `CSS` in an idiomatic way is difficult and is therefore postponed for later projects.
